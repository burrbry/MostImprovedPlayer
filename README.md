# Most Improved Player
Create a model that attempts to predict who will win the 2021-2022 NBA Most Improved Player Award.
This is achieved by taking all players stats from seasons 2016-2021 and creating data frames that show each players "improvement" from year to year. Improvement is their stats from one year subtracted by the next.
A Random Forest Model is then created, tested, and validated to predict who should win the award.
